Package: clamav-testfiles-rar
Description-md5: b543a48c75c4b07d1924eccf1275d8a5
Description-en: anti-virus utility for Unix - test files
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains files 'infected' with a test signature. The test
 signature (ClamAV-Test-Signature) should be detectable by all
 anti-virus programs. The files are limited to .rar files.
